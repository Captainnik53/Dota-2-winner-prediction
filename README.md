# Dota-2-winner-prediction
Prediction of a DOTA match based on the stats available in the first 5 minutes of the game. 
I have used Logistics Regression to predict the winner and achieved an AUC-ROC = 75. Further improvements can be done with respect to the features for the prediction which might increase the auc score.
Dataset was obtained from archive of public games of OpenDota.com(YASP).
